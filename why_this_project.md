## Why this Project?

I’m excited to apply for the AI-Enabled Choreography project because it perfectly combines two areas that inspire me: art and deep learning. When I first read about this project, I thought, “Finally, a chance to merge creativity with cutting-edge tech!”

## Background in Music and Culture

My artistic journey is rooted in music production. I’ve produced various EDM tracks—including future bass, future house, and even a few rap/EDM mashups. You can check out some of my work on my [NetEase Music artist page](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=12037128). Born in Xinjiang, China, I’m Uyghur, and my culture is celebrated as “a nation of song and dance.” Growing up surrounded by music and movement has ignited my passion for blending traditional art with modern technology.

Even as a beginner in deep learning, I’ve been exploring AI-driven music tools and am impressed by how technology can amplify artistic expression. The benefits are exciting—quicker prototyping, real-time feedback, and boundless creative possibilities. I also understand the importance of preserving that raw human touch, ensuring that art remains heartfelt and resonant.

I value clear, thoughtful communication—preferably via text or email—to keep our creative process well-documented and collaborative. My big vision for this project is to merge dance and music generation into one cohesive ecosystem- a platform like Ableton Live with an integrated “ChoreoAI” plugin that choreographs movements and lighting cues in perfect sync with freshly generated tracks. This synergy could open innovative avenues for both music producers and choreographers.

## Final Thoughts

Thank you for considerition. I’m eager to learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of AI-infused artistry alongside a team that shares my passion for creativity and technology. Let’s create something extraordinary together!
